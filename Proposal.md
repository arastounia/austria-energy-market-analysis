# Austria Energy Market Analysis

This project analyzes Austria’s electricity system using real-world hourly datasets. By combining market prices, load profiles, generation data, and cross-border transmission flows, the analysis explores how renewable energy influences price dynamics, how demand varies seasonally, and how Austria exchanges electricity with neighboring countries such as Germany, Italy, and Hungary.

## Methodology

### **1. Data Collection**
The analysis uses openly available hourly datasets, including:
- Day-ahead electricity market prices (€/MWh)  
- Actual and forecast electricity load (MW)  
- Generation by production type (wind, solar, hydro, fossil)  
- Cross-border physical flows between Austria and neighboring countries  

---

### **2. Statistical & Correlation Analysis**
To quantify system behavior, the project applies:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, variance, distribution trends)  
- Correlation analysis between renewable generation, total load, and market prices  
- Basic regression to estimate the impact of renewables on price formation  

---

### **3. Comparative & Transmission Flow Analysis**
The study compares seasonal variations in Austria’s generation structure and evaluates physical electricity exchanges.  
Visualizations (Sankey diagrams, bar charts) illustrate:
- Net imports and exports  
- Regional electricity interdependencies  
- Cross-border flow patterns over time

## Key Questions

1. How do fluctuations in renewable generation (wind, solar) influence Austria’s day-ahead electricity prices?  
2. What are the daily and seasonal trends in electricity demand, and how do they relate to market behavior?  
3. How does Austria’s generation mix evolve throughout the year, and what share is renewable?  
4. Which countries are Austria’s main electricity trading partners, and how do flow patterns change over time?  
5. What insights emerge regarding the overall balance and interdependence of the Austrian electricity system?
